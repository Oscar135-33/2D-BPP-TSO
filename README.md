Welcome, this repository was made for educational pourposes by Oscar, Guillermo, Derek & Yahir.
Here a brief explanation of the proyect:
This proyect consists about studying the Bidimensional Bin Packing Problem from... 
..Combinatorial Optimization.
Our goal was to propose a new heuristic method to try to find good and feasible solutions in a 
razonable computation time.
For this proyect we coded the heuristic with python.
And we used 15 instances from a 2D-BPP benchmark to test our code performance & efficiency.
In this repository is a PDF file report where all the study and testing was documented.
To try the Heuristic code for yourself we recommend you to install python and Spyder software
in your PC.
Then download the zip file.
Extract the content.
With Spyder open the python code.
Then inside the main function in the code youÂ´ll need to modify the address where the instances
are located in your computer.
Lastly you need to modify the value from the variable "filename" in the main function 
and you give the name of the instance to test.
Finally run the code and there you are.
